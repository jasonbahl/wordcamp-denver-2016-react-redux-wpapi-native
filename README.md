# iOS React Native Demo App demonstrating using React (native), Redux and the WP Rest API

This was built to show how easy it is to learn React and Redux for the web, and apply the same principles, and even the exact same code to build a native mobile app with React Native. 

The web project this compliments is here: https://github.com/jasonbahl/wordcamp-denver-2016-react-redux-wpapi

# Run the iOS app (sorry, there currently is no Android version in this demo)

To run the app, make sure you have xcode installed. Then, in the command line, navigate to the directory where you cloned this repo and run `react-native run-ios`
